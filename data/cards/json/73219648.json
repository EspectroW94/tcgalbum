When this card is targeted by the effect of a card controlled by your opponent, when resolving the effect, roll a six-sided die. If the result is 3, negate the effect and destroy the opponent's card. As long as this card remains on the field, your opponent cannot attack any Archfiend Monster Card on your side of the field except \"Vilepawn Archfiend\"."
