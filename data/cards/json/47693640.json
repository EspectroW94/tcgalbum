While equipped by this effect, the equipped monster gains 500 ATK/DEF. If the equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster by battle: Discard 1 random card from their hand. (A monster can only be equipped with 1 Union monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle, destroy this card instead.)"
